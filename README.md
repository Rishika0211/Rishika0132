Stone Paper Scissor 
PROJECT TITLE - STONE PAPER SCISSOR
This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how data structures and basic programming concepts can be applied to create a classic game – Stone Paper Scissors – using the C programming language. It was developed as part of the second-semester coursework for the Bachelor of Computer Applications at Chandigarh University, under the subject “Data Structures Using C”.

The primary objective of the project is to allow a user to play the game against the computer. The player can choose between stone, paper, or scissors, represented by the characters ‘s’, ‘p’, and ‘x’ respectively. The computer's choice is randomly generated using the rand() function, simulating the unpredictable nature of a real opponent. The winner is then decided based on a function that implements the standard rules of the game.

This project utilizes fundamental concepts such as functions, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation. While the program does not use complex data structures, it lays a strong foundation for logical thinking and decision-making, which are essential in data structure implementation.
